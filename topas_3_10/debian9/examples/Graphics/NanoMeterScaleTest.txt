# This example demonstrates an issue that occurs when there
# is a very large zoom factor and how to work around that issue.
# You will see that the display is not exactly centered on the
# desired component, and that, if you try to adjust the Theta or Phi,
# the change is not smooth but instead has discontinuities.
# The issue is resolved if one makes the world invisible,
# as this means the initial extent of the displayed scene only
# contains the nm scale components, so little or no zoom is required.
