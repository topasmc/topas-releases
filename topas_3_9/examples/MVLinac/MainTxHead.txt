# This is the top-level TOPAS parameter control file used to simulate a linear
# accelerator treatment head. The linac is modeled after a Siemens Oncor machine.
#
# The exit window, target and monitor chamber are largely from Jabbari et al,
# "Monte Carlo simulation of Siemens ONCOR linear accelerator with BEAMnrc and
# DOSXYnrc code," J Med Signals & Sensors, 3(3):172-9, 2013.
#
# The water channel thickness in the exit window, source details and the rest
# of the geometry are from Sawkey and Faddegon, "Simulation of large x-ray fields
# using independently measured source and geometry details," Med Phys 36(12):5622-32
# and references therein, supplemented with direct measurement.
#
# Treatment head components are positioned at distance from source according to SAD.
#
# Example prepared by KyungDon Choi, Jose Ramos Mendez and Bruce Faddegon. May 28, 2021.

# Uncomment one and only one of the following four includeFile lines:
#includeFile = FullTxHead.txt
includeFile = FixedTxHead.txt
#includeFile = Field.txt
#includeFile = TestComponent.txt
#
# FullTxHead.txt
#    Simulates the full treatment head, from the exit window of the waveguide
#    through to the isocenter. Change gantry, collimator and couch angles and
#    field size settings from defaults set in the includeFile files included
#    in FullTxHead.txt. Does not contain any scoring.
#
# FixedTxHead.txt
#    Simulates the fixed components of the treatment head from the exit window
#    to just upstream of the jaws. Scores phase space.
#
# Field.txt
#    Simulates the movable components of the treatment head, including Gantry,
#    collimator angle, jaw and MLC leaves. Change gantry, collimator and couch 
#    angles and field size settings from defaults set in the includeFile files 
#    included in Field.txt. Scores dose distributions.
#
# TestComponent.txt
#    Displays one or more of the linac components in the GUI. Change parameter
#    values in the includeFile files (these contain the default values). 

# The above four includeFiles in turn include one or more of the following:
# Target.txt: Exit window and target
# Flattener.txt: Primary collimator and flattening filter
# Monitor.txt: Monitor chamber  
# Jaws.txt: Pair of asymmetric beam-defining jaws
# MLC.txt: Opposing banks of doubly-diverging MLC leaves of different widths and travel
# PhaseSpace.txt: Phase-space scored on plane perpendicular to beam axis
# WaterPhantom.txt: Voxelized water phantom for scoring dose distributions
# Pelvis.txt: DICOM pelvic phantom
# LinacDefaults.txt: Default field and patient specific parameters

# Parameter Descriptions
# IEC 61217 co-ordinates are used in this example. See the TOPAS user guide for details
# Axis names Xa, Ya, Za, rotation angles RotXa, RotYa, RotZa "a" from IEC as follows:
#   Fixed system IEC_F, parent Geant4 world - e.g. Xf; (Xf,Yf,Zf) is world (-Z,-X,Y) 
#   Gantry system IEC_G, parent IEC_F - e.g. Xg; Gantry rotates about Yg by IEC_G/RotY
#   Beam limiting system IEC_B, parent IEC_G; Collimator rotates about Zb by IEC_B/RotZ
#   Patient support system (couch) IEC_S, parent IEC_F - couch rotates by RotZs
#   In this example, table top eccentric rotation and translation combined with patient 
#   Patient (in this example, DICOM CT image) IECp, parent IEC_S - rotate about all axes
#
# HLX/Y/Z: half length of X/Y/Z axes
# TransX/Y/Z: translation of X/Y/Z axes relative to co-ordinates of parent
# RotX/Y/Z: rotation of X/Y/Z axes relative to co-ordinates of parent

# The parameters in this TOPAS control file need not be changed.
# Parameters the user may wish to adjust are in the includeFile included above.
